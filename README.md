This project was made for the evaluation of the innovative work for the subject of Analog Electronics.

The project aims at studying about audio equalizers and filters, their construction, operation and various applications. Finally we simulate and analyze a three-channel/band audio equalizer using a suitable electronic design simulation software and studying the corresponding input-output waveforms.
